A Emacs auto-complete source for Processing code.

Still a work in progress.

Requires Emacs compiled with libxml2 due to the use of the `shr`
library. By default only Emacs 24 has the `shr` library
pre-installed. For older Emacsen you will need to install the `shr`
library from the [Gnus](www.gnus.org) repository.
